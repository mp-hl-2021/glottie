## Glottie Chat User Stories

1. As a researcher whose native language is not English, I want to communicate with peer colleagues in a chat-room where all messages are translated automatically, so that I don't have to fight with English grammar and correct word usage.
2. As a chat service user, I want to obtain a unique account, so that my personal identity couldn't be forged.
3. As an authenticated user, I need to be able to create new chat-rooms dedicated to cerain topics and invite other fellow researchers to join them.
4. As a chat participant, I want to preview the content of each of my messages and make sure the system makes an adequate semantic interpretation of it, so that I could rest assured the intended meaning will come across.
5. As an invited chat guest, I want to join the discussions without registration, so that I could remain anonymous.
6. As a chat participant, I want to see all messages from other users translated to my mother tongue, so that I don't have to learn other foreign languages.
7. As a researcher, I need to communicate with people from other countries, so that we could form an international research community.
